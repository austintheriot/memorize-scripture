      "distribution_about": "This text began as an electronic transcription by Whitaker and Parunak of the 1983 printed edition of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS). The transcription is called the Michigan-Claremont electronic text and was archived at the Oxford Text Archive (OTA) in 1987. Since that time, the text has been modified to conform to the photo-facsimile of the Leningrad Codex, Firkovich B19A, residing at the Russian National Library, St. Petersberg; hence the change of name. This version contains all 6 of the textual elements of the OTA document: consonants, vowels, cantillation marks, \"paragraph\" (pe, samekh) markers, and ketiv-qere variants. Morphological divisions have been added.\\par\\par The BHS so-called \"paragraph\" markers (pe and samekh) do not actually occur in the Leningrad Codex. The editors of BHS use them to indicate open space deliberately left blank by the scribe. Pe (\"open\" paragraph) represents a space between verses, where the new verse begins on a new column line. This represents a major section of the text. Samekh (\"closed\" paragraph) represents a space of less than a line between verses. This is understood to be a subdivision of the corresponding \"open\" section. Since these markers represent an actual physical feature of the text, they have been retained.\\par\\par The WLC is maintained by the Westminster Hebrew Institute, Philadelphia, PA (http://whi.wts.edu/WHI). This edition is based on Christopher V. Kimball's edition (http://www.tanach.us/Tanach.xml), which also adds textual source assignment based in the Pentateuch on the documentary hypothesis.",

The NT Strong's data was obtained from The KJV2003 Project at CrossWire: http://www.crosswire.org.  These mechanisms provide a useful means for looking up the exact original language word in a lexicon that is keyed to Strong's numbers.\\par\\par Special thanks to the volunteers at Bible Foundation for keying the Hebrew/English data and of Project KJV2003 for working toward the completion of synchronizing the English phrases to the Stephanas Textus Receptus, and to Dr. Maurice Robinson for providing the base Greek text with Strong's and Morphology.  We are also appreciative of formatting markup that was provided by Michael Paul Johnson at http://www.ebible.org.  Their time and generosity to contribute such for the free use of the Body of Christ is a great blessing and this derivitive work could not have been possible without these efforts of so many individuals.
