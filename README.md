## About

The art of memory has been a fascination of mine for a long time. Over the years, I've practiced memorizing poems, morse code, numbers, quotes, words, names, songs, trivia, hymns, and texts from the Bible. Out of all the things I've memorized, however, extended memorization of the Bible in particular has proven to me to be one of the greatest personal treasures. To carry God's Word in my heart and to have it on my mind at any hour of the day or night is an incredible blessing. Additionally, I firmly believe it's of enormous benefit to the Christian to memorize large portions of Scripture **in its context**, without the distraction of verse numbers and footnotes, appreciating the ebb and flow of the book and its arguments.

But let's face it: memorization, for the vast majority of people, isn't _enjoyable_. More often than not, it's a laborious process, fraught with frustration and failure. For this reason, many people give up when trying to memorize Bible verses or stop after they've learned only a verse or two. But I don't think it has to be this way. Most people have just never learned _how_ to learn. 

I first stumbled on the idea of condensing a text to memorize it via [this article](http://www.productivity501.com/how-to-memorize-verbatim-text/294/) by Mark Shead. After finding the article, I began implementing the process in my own Bible memorization, and I have personally found the process to be so much more quick and painless ever since. And that's my end goal for this app: to facilitate the extended memorization of God's Word.

This app has been created with the permission of [ESV.org](https://www.esv.org/), from which all Bible quotes are drawn, unless otherwise indicated.

## How it Works

First we take the original text of a passage. Let's use Psalm 117 (ESV) for example:

    Praise the LORD, all nations!
              Extol him, all peoples!
        For great is his steadfast love toward us,
              and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever.
        Praise the LORD!

If we condense the text down to only the first letters of each word and surrounding punctuation we get:

    PtL,an!
    Eh,ap!
    Fgihsltu,
    atfotLef.
    PtL!

We can then memorize this Psalm by simply looking at the condensed version while we practice speaking the **original** text, referring back to the original as needed. _Note: we aren't trying to pronounce the condensed version._ We are only using the condensed version as a guide to speak the original text. Once the entire text can be spoken while looking only at the condensed version, you will find that you have already memorized a significant portion of the passage. All that is left is to practice speaking the text without looking at the letters at all.

This works because of a psychological principle called ["chunking" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), in which individual pieces of information are grouped together into a collected whole. This helps us remember more than we normally would be able to. This is also why we tend to group phone numbers into 3 groups of 3 or 4: "(012) 345-6789" rather than just 10 digits all lumped together "0123456789." The principle applies when memorizing a text: reducing a passage down to its first letters allows to "chunk" a text in groups of phrases, sentences, and verses rather than individual words. 

Rather than flipping back and forth between the condensed text and the original text, it becomes even easier if we listen to the audio of the original text while looking at the condensed text and speaking along, rewinding as needed.

Once the text is memorized, it's important to review the what we have learned. I always begin my study sessions with review before learning any new material. If pressed for time, it's far better to retain the words you've already worked so hard to learn than to learn new passages. One of the most efficient ways that I have found to review passages is by review chapters of a book at a time using a spaced repetition flash card system, such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). You can also implement this type of system with pen-and-paper flashcards as well. A spaced repetition flash card system allows us to review a text right before we might normally forget it. Over time, the review intervals become longer and longer, and we remember it better and better, allowing us to solidify a text in our long term memory while minimizing the burden of review time (because let's face it: there's only so much time in the day!). 

I hope you find this app to be of benefit in your own faith walk.
