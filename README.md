## About

### Intro

The art of memory has been a fascination of mine for a long time. Over the years, I've practiced memorizing many different kinds of information, but extended memorization of the Bible in particular has proven to me to be one of the greatest personal treasures. To carry God's Word in my heart and to have it on my mind at any hour of the day or night is an incredible blessing. Additionally, I firmly believe it's of enormous benefit to the Christian to memorize large portions of Scripture at a time, in its context, without the distraction of verse numbers and footnotes, appreciating the ebb and flow of a psalm, chapter, or even a book and its contents.

But let's face it: memorization, for the vast majority of people, isn't enjoyable. More often than not, it's a laborious process, filled with frustration and failure rather than success. For this reason, many people give up when trying to memorize Bible verses or stop after they've learned only a verse or two. But I don't think it has to be this way. Most people have just never learned how to learn.

I first stumbled on the idea of condensing a text to memorize it via [this article by Mark Shead](http://www.productivity501.com/how-to-memorize-verbatim-text/294/). After finding the article, I began implementing the process in my own Bible memorization, and I have personally found the process to be so much more quick and painless ever since then. And that's my end goal for this app: to facilitate the extended memorization of God's Word. This same technique is also used by a few other scripture memory softwares ([memverse.com](https://www.memverse.com/) for example), but I hope to offer a more mobile-friendly, streamlined app here, one that is focused on extended memorization, rather than collections of shorter verses.

This app has been created with the permission of the creators of the [English Standard Bible (ESV)](https://www.esv.org/), from which all Bible quotes are drawn, unless otherwise indicated.

### App Installation

By default, this app is available for offline use by visiting [https://memorizescripture.org/](https://memorizescripture.org/) in your browser, even without an internet connection (as long as you've visited the page once in the last year). Your last 5 most recently accessed chapters are automatically saved and are available for viewing anywhere and anytime.

For a more app-like experience on mobile devices and some desktop devices, you can add this website to your home screen. This creates an icon for the website, and when you open the webpage by tapping on it, the app will open in standalone mode (no address bar or navigation menu getting in the way), like a native app. See below for instructions.

#### Android Users:

Launch Chrome for Android and open [https://memorizescripture.org/](https://memorizescripture.org/). Tap the menu button and tap Add to Home Screen. You’ll be able to enter a name for the shortcut and then Chrome will add it to your home screen.

#### iPhone, iPad, & iPod Users:

Launch Safari and go to [https://memorizescripture.org/](https://memorizescripture.org/). Tap the Share button on the browser’s toolbar (the rectangle with upward-pointing arrow). This can be found on the bar at the top of the screen on an iPad, and on the bar at the bottom of the screen on an iPhone or iPod Touch. Tap "Add to Home Screen". You'll be able to name the shortcut, and then Safari will add the shortcut to your home screen.

#### Desktop:

When opened with Google Chrome, this app can be installed to the desktop by clicking the "install" button at the top of the window to the right of the address bar. If you don't see the word "install", you might see a small plus sign instead.

### How to Memorize

If you've never tried to memorize an extended passage of scripture before, or have only ever memorized a verse or two at a time, start with a short Psalm that you like.

In this example, we'll practice by using Psalm 117, but feel free to use whatever text you prefer:

    Praise the LORD, all nations!
              Extol him, all peoples!
        For great is his steadfast love toward us,
              and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever.
        Praise the LORD!

If we condense the text down to only the first letters of each word and surrounding punctuation we get:

    PtL,an!
    Eh,ap!
    Fgihsltu,
    atfotLef.
    PtL!

Here is how to memorize it (and really any chapter from the Bible):

  1. Speak the entire (original) text out loud a few times, or listen to the audio version of the text a few times. Do this until you feel like you have a strong sense of the overall meaning of the passage as a whole.
  2. Look up any unfamiliar words or the meaning of particular verses that you don't understand. It's vital to understand what you memorize and not just mindlessly cram it into your brain!
  3. Start with the first line. There are two primary methods:
      - Look only at the condensed text while you listen to the audio version of the text. Focus on line at a time. Listen to the line and try to speak it as you listen. If you get it wrong, rewind the audio and try again. Do this until you can speak the line perfectly while looking at the condensed text.
      - The second method is to flip back and forth between the condensed text and the original text. Practice speaking the original text while looking at the condensed text only. If you can't remember the line, refer back to the original text. Do this until you can speak the line perfectly while looking only at the condensed text.
  4. Complete this process for line 1 only. Move onto line 2, and focus on it alone. Once you can speak line 2, practice speaking both line 1 and line 2 together while looking only at the condensed text. Once this is comfortable, move onto line 3 and practice it alone until it's comfortable. Then practice speaking line 1, 2, and 3 together. Continue this process for the entire passage. I call this the pyramid method of learning, because you're gradually building up from a base of text you know well, moving into less familiar text. The pattern ends up looking something like this:

    1
    12
    123
    12345
    123456
    1234567 etc.

You will find that once you can speak the entire passage by looking only at the condensed text, you already have most of the passage memorized. All that's left to do is practice speaking the text without looking at the letters at all. (Hint: you can then memorize the text without looking by following the same pyramid pattern of repetition).

### How This Technique Works

This process works well for most people because of a psychological principle called ["chunking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), in which individual pieces of information are grouped together into a collected whole. Chunking helps us remember more than we normally would be able to if we were trying to remember the same information as individual pieces. This is why we tend to group long numbers into 3 groups of 3 or 4, such as phone numbers: "(012) 345-6789" rather than "0123456789." The principle also applies when memorizing a text: reducing a passage down to its first letters allows us to "chunk" a text in groups of phrases, sentences, and verses rather than as individual words.

### How To Review

Once the text is memorized, it's important to regularly review what you have learned. I always begin my study sessions with review before learning any new material. If pressed for time, it's far better to retain the words you've already worked so hard to learn than to learn new passages.

On the [Review Page](https://memorizescripture.org/review), you can test your knowledge of a passage by typing it into the Input box. The tester only grades the letters you type, ignoring punctuation, capitalization, line breaks, and spaces. This is so that you can more easily test yourself by using your phone's speech-to-text feature, if available. Most mobile phones should allow you to use this feature to speak the passage while your phone transcribes the text into the input box, instead of having to manually type the passage.

An alternative is to simply record yourself speaking the passage from memory. Then listen to the recording and check that you've spoken it accurately by looking at the original text. I hope to add this feature to the app as a built-in option in the near feature.

I typically review individual chapters of a book at a time with the audio method, which takes around 5-10 minutes per day. Additionally, whenever I'm driving, I often practice reciting an entire book (without looking at the app) or I recite along with an audio bible to ensure I'm not making any mistakes. Please don't try to use this app while driving!

One of the most efficient ways that I have found to time my reviews is by using a spaced repetition flash card system, such as Anki to remind me when a passage is due for review. Although it's possible to implement this type of system with pen-and-paper flashcards, Anki saves a lot of time in the long run, especially when creating flashcards is as simple as copying and pasting from the internet. A spaced repetition flash card system allows you to review a text right before you might normally forget it. Over time, the review intervals become longer and longer, allowing you to solidify a text in your long term memory while minimizing the burden of review time (because let's face it: there's only so much time in the day!).
