## About

### Intro

The art of memory has been a fascination of mine for a long time. Over the years, I've practiced memorizing poems, numbers, quotes, words, names, songs, trivia, hymns, and texts from the Bible. Out of all the things I've memorized, however, extended memorization of the Bible in particular has proven to me to be one of the greatest personal treasures. To carry God's Word in my heart and to have it on my mind at any hour of the day or night is an incredible blessing. Additionally, I firmly believe it's of enormous benefit to the Christian to memorize large portions of Scripture **in its context**, without the distraction of verse numbers and footnotes, appreciating the ebb and flow of the book and its arguments.

But let's face it: memorization, for the vast majority of people, isn't _enjoyable_. More often than not, it's a laborious process, filled with frustration and failure rather than success. For this reason, many people give up when trying to memorize Bible verses or stop after they've learned only a verse or two. But I don't think it has to be this way. Most people have just never learned _how_ to learn. 

I first stumbled on the idea of condensing a text to memorize it via [this article](http://www.productivity501.com/how-to-memorize-verbatim-text/294/) by Mark Shead. After finding the article, I began implementing the process in my own Bible memorization, and I have personally found the process to be so much more quick and painless ever since. And that's my end goal for this app: to facilitate the extended memorization of God's Word.

This app has been created with the permission of the creators of the [English Standard Bible (ESV)](https://www.esv.org/), from which all Bible quotes are drawn, unless otherwise indicated.

### Instructions

First we take the original text of a passage. Let's use Psalm 117 (ESV) for example:

    Praise the LORD, all nations!
              Extol him, all peoples!
        For great is his steadfast love toward us,
              and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever.
        Praise the LORD!

If we condense the text down to only the first letters of each word and surrounding punctuation we get:

    PtL,an!
    Eh,ap!
    Fgihsltu,
    atfotLef.
    PtL!

Here is how to memorize it (and really any chapter from the Bible):
  1. Speak the entire (original) text aloud a few times, or listen to the audio version of the text a few times. Do this until you feel like you have a strong sense of the overall meaning of the passage as a whole. 
  2. Look up any unfamiliar words or the meaning of particular verses that you don't understand. It's vital to _understand_ what you memorize and not simply mindlessly cram it into your brain! 
  3. Start with the first line. There are two primary methods: 
      -  Look only at the **condensed** text while you listen to the audio version of the text. Focus on line at a time. Listen to the line and try to speak it as you listen. If you get it wrong, rewind the audio and try again. Do this until you can speak the line perfectly while looking at the condensed text. 
      -  The second method is to flip back and forth between the condensed text and the original text. Practice speaking the **original** text while looking at the condensed text only. Do this until you can speak the line perfectly while looking at the condensed text. 
  4. Complete this process for line 1 only. Move onto line 2, and focus on it alone. Once you can speak line 2, practice speaking both line 1 and line 2 together while looking only at the condensed text. Once this is comfortable, move onto line 3 and practice it alone until it's comfortable. Then practice speaking line 1, 2, and 3 together. Continue this process for the entire passage. I call this the pyramid method of learning, because you're gradually building up from a base of text you know well, moving into less familiar text. The pattern ends up looking something like this: 
  
          1
          12
          123
          12345
          123456
          1234567
          etc. 

You will find that once you can speak the entire passage by looking only at the condensed text, you already have most of the passage memorized. All that's left to do is practice speaking the text without looking at the letters at all. (Hint: you can then memorize the text without looking by following the same pyramid pattern of repetition).

### How It Works

This process works well for most people because of a psychological principle called ["chunking" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)), in which individual pieces of information are grouped together into a collected whole. Chunking helps us remember more than we normally would be able to if we were trying to remember the same information as individual pieces. This is why we tend to group long numbers into 3 groups of 3 or 4, such as phone numbers: "(012) 345-6789" rather than "0123456789." The principle also applies when memorizing a text: reducing a passage down to its first letters allows us to "chunk" a text in groups of phrases, sentences, and verses rather than as individual words. 

### Review

Once the text is memorized, it's important to regularly review what we have learned. I always begin my study sessions with review _before_ learning any new material. If pressed for time, it's far better to retain the words you've already worked so hard to learn than to learn new passages. One of the most efficient ways that I have found to review passages is by reviewing individual chapters of a book at a time. I recommend using a spaced repetition flash card system, such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), although it's also possible implement this type of system with pen-and-paper flashcards instead. A spaced repetition flash card system allows us to review a text right before we might normally forget it. Over time, the review intervals become longer and longer, allowing us to solidify a text in our long term memory while minimizing the burden of review time (because let's face it: there's only so much time in the day!).
